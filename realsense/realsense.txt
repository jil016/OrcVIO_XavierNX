pre-build packages: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/distribution_linux.md
*source packages: https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation.md

(1) try pre-build packages
...No debian package support, sudo apt-get install librealsense2-dkms failed, others succeed, but still worked...


(2) try pre-build packages
(Failed) Build and apply patched kernel modules; ./scripts/patch-realsense-ubuntu-lts.sh


(3) realsense-ros
sudo apt install ros-melodic-ddynamic-reconfigure
sudo ln -s /usr/local/include/opencv /usr/include/opencv (!!! Not really reasonable, this is because, it uses default cv_bridge which requires usr/include/opencv)
